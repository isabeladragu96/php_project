This is a project I made as an assignment for univeristy. It is called 'Ghid oras. Organizare evenimente'. It has in its composition the following: 
    - sign up / sign in page implemented with cookies
    - one menu page where you can see the events' categories
    - if you click on one category, for example theatre, you get a list of all the events and you can apply some filters
    - the menu bar is always on top of the page if you want to switch the pages quickly
