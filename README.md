This is a project I made as an assignment for univeristy. It is called 'Ghid oras. Organizare evenimente'. It has in its composition the following: 
    - sign up / sign in page implemented with cookies
    - one menu page where you can see the events' categories
    - if you click on one category, for example theatre, you get a list of all the events and you can apply some filters
    - the menu bar is always on top of the page if you want to switch the pages quickly
    
    
  I used XAMPP for my server connection because I implemented the project in PHP using MySQL. I also used PHPmyadmin to create my database and manage it throughout the project. 
  
  index.php is the main page if you want to open the project.
